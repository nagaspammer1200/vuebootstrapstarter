This is a basic template for any Vue JS project which incorporates Bootstrap CSS.

Bootstrap CSS has been included in the files using a CDN in the index.html. My experience with Bootstrap has lead to me using the CDN to initialize Bootstrap. Using npm command did not yield much results.

Vue used is version 3.4.21 <br/><br/>
React used is version 18.2.66<br/><br/>

Steps to use:
<br/>
1. Open a new empty folder in VS Code.<br/><br/>
2. Copy the below code in the terminal<br/><br/>
   
       git clone https://github.com/nagaspammer1200/vuebootstrapstarter.git
       cd vuebootstrapstarter
       npm install 
       npm run dev
  <br/><br/>


Happy Coding !!!
