This is a basic template for any Vue JS project which incorporates Bootstrap CSS.

Bootstrap CSS has been included in the files using a CDN in the index.html. My experience with Bootstrap has lead to me using the CDN to initialize Bootstrap. Using npm command did not yield much results.

Vue used is version 3.4.21

Steps to use:

Open a new empty folder in VS Code. Copy the below code in the terminal

 git clone https://github.com/nagaspammer1200/BasicReactStarter.git
 cd BasicReactStarter
 npm install 
 npm run dev
After the npm run dev, you should see instructions to load the basic structure locally

Happy Coding !!!
